Registered application with Google Developers Console and received my OAuth 2.0 
credentials.

Virtual environment created for this project with the following installed:
    Google api libraries for python using pip 

Implementing Gmail RESTful API:
    Used Google Sign-in to provide the user secure login and to avoid the user from
    having to remember an additional username and passwords. This is to be worked on
    next on Monday, May 9: User signs in and chooses their account, they would have 
    to allow sign-in and request permission in order to access their inbox.


Created model.py, server.py, seed.py, tests.py as well as the skeleton templates to 
assist in testing the Gmail scopes. To be updated on Monday, May 9.
